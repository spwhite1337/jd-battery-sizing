# Utility Battery Sizing

An engineer at a [redacted] company asked me to assess the load profile of their power gen site in order to estimate the
size of a proposed battery that would decrease their peak demand. 

## Procedure

- Python 3.5
- `cd jd-battery-sizing`
- `pip install -e .`
- Optional: Add jupyter kernel `python -m ipykernel install --user --name [v-env] --display-name "Python (v-env)"`

## Calculate

- Get the data from me
- Run `results.ipynb`
